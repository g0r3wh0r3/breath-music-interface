## respiratory inductance plethysmography 
* whats used in medical devices for respiratory  monitoring 
* [RIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_inductance_plethysmography#:~:text=Respiratory%20inductance%20plethysmography%20\(RIP\)%20is,coupled%20to%20the%20airway%20opening.) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMgPrCn_1Uk)
* Often it uses two bands, the thoracic which goes over your ribs/chest, and the abdominal which goes over your belly. Could be interesting to use both, especially for vocalists
