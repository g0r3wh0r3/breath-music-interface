Inputs are signals from the user that we would be collecting. They would then be mapped to an [[output]]
“expression” input. So this would be the sensor hardware, as in the actual breath band part if I decide to make that. Should be compatible to just plug and use in place of an expression pedal, so outputs a variable resistance across a TRS jack.
