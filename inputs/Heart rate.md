- heart rate sensors work through photoplethysmography which detects changes in blood volume 
- light shines on the skin, the amount that is reflected back is related to the blood volume 
-  the frequencies that get reflected back is related to the oxygen saturation (oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more infrared light, deoxygenated absorbs more red, less infrared) 
- the signal that comes back from this is periodic w/ spikes at heart beats 
-  there will be noise from the user's movement needs to be filtered out (or, maybe not for this application . . . )
- if i get an off-the-shelf HR monitor it'll just give me a digital signal, like just the bpm? i think I might want the raw waveform tho am I going to have to make one myself? that could be fun . .
