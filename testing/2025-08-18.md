found not-broken BNC cables so set up to test using the oscilloscope wave gen to supply the pulse instead of turning on and off the power supply very fast 

set up with inductor in parallel with 6.8 uF capacitor as before, just saw very low signal on the scope, jumping around between saying "low signal" and occasionally jumping around between 30-50 MHz 

If that is correct, that would give that the coil has L around 1.5 to 4 pH which is probably too small anyway? 
Here's some pictures I took of what showed up on the scope :
