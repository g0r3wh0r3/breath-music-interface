Set up the same circuit on breadboard as last time with the 3.3 uF capacitor, diode, and resistor. Tested using pulse on the function generator and got different values than last time. Took multiple readings with it unstretched and stretched and got 43 nH, 50.3 nH, 38.2 nH unstretched. Holding the wire in place on the breadboard (it's too thin to stay in the breadboard holes) while also stretching the band and taking measurements was difficult and the measurements were probably garbage. 

Forgot to get images from the scope and forgot to write down exact settings on function generator used. 

Started adding fuzz circuitry to ltspice simulation. https://www.electrosmash.com/fuzz-face (see design\breath_coil.asc for the ltspice file )

To do: 
- need to make a better testing setup. possibly putting together something to hold the wires in place for more reliable testing as an alternative to my breadboard 
- make a better coil -> cover all the way around the band, tighter coils (need to find/acquire much more of that thin copper wire)
- analyse/understand the fuzz face output stage circuit (section 4 in link above)
- figure out how to make ltspice simulate the indictance changing if that is possible
