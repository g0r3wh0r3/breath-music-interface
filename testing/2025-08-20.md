Tested the band with the enamel wire sewn in, using 1.0Vpp, 250 kHz sine wave. 
Voltage across band varied from ~53 mV to to 50mV when inhaling/exhaling.

Trying to look at the signal on the scope gave some weird looking signals that I didn't understand. Setup probably has a lot of noise because the only oscilloscope probes I could find are all broken so was using a lot of alligator clips/wire to hold everything together. Tried to test with a capacitor in parallel (tried 0.1 uF and 1 nF), tried adding a small (270 ohm) resistor in parallel with inductor.

Adjusting the frequency of the sine wave to try to find the highest voltage across the band. Seems to be around 1.55 MHz, the voltage is around 0.502 V.
