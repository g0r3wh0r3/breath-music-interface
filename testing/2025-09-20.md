trying to measure the inductance value of the homemade band 
method: 
- set up inductor in parallel with capacitor  
- send a pulse across the LC circuit 
- on the scope, should see ringing. get the frequency 
- f = $\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} $ f and C are known, solve for L 

could not find another BNC cable to use w/ function generator for the pulse, so we used the DC supply and just clicked the power on/off super fast :')

$L = \frac{\mu_{0}N^{2}A}{l}$, the coil has N=120 turns, l=14 cm long, and A=1cm^2, very roughly, so  I would expect something around 1 mH, very roughly, (which is pretty good since a few mH is usually what I see in other pedals/audio applications)

using a 6.8 uF capacitor, we saw that the frequency was ~59 Hz. this gives L = 1.07 H  

which seems kinda high but maybe could be plausible, but ~60 Hz could just picking up mains hum, so checked again with a different capacitor, hoping to see a different frequency and calculate a similar value for L. 

using 1000 pF, the frequency we saw was 60.215 Hz, which would give L = 7kH !!! 

so obviously these values are garbage and we need a better setup. will try again next week and try to find the right supplies to test properly. need BNC cables that are not broken. might be able to acquire/borrow LCR meter, tried to find one during spring term but might have better luck when more people/resources are around in the fall.
