I tried following this tutorial https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/how-to-measure-inductance-or-capacitance-using-oscilloscope 
Set up the circuit exactly as it is in the tutorial and still wasn't able to see anything on the scope. Maybe the inductor just isn't going to work. I've not been making any progress for a really long time and should probably give up on the inductor method, so I will start figuring out other waysI can get a breath signal. Even though the inductor method was cool and I think the concept is cool, I also just want to have something that works and it looks like this isn't going to.
