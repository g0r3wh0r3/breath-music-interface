tried testing to see if the cables I found were working and tried connecting the wave gen of the oscilloscope straight to the input and didn't see anything. Probably I just don't know how to set it up properly. Switched to using the actual function generator and it worked. we got something that looks kind of similar to what the video shows and measured the period. 

I made another coil just to see what the output looked like. I don't have any other inductor with a known value to actually check that this method is working though.

When we tested with the band, we got that the period was 12.2 ns when it was relaxed, and 11.2 nS when I stretched it. I used a 3.3 uF capacitor (the leg broke off the 6.8 uF one)

$f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$

$L = \frac{1}{(2\pi f)^2 C}$ 

this gives values of 0.9628 pH when the band is stretched and 1.142 pH when it's relaxed. Which is insanely tiny. Decreasing the length and increasing the number of turns, so having a shorted, tigther-wound coil would help. I might try to make a tighter-wound band and test it.

The signal on the scope also looks really similar to what I was getting a few weeks ago (2025-10-18) and it was probably working fine then, and I just had to adjust the time/div on the scope (since L is super tiny f will be huge). oops.

I also experienced a thought today. likely the commercial RIP bands wind the coil the other direction, as in having only a few turns going around the person's body, so that the cross-sectional area of the inductor would change as your body expands with breathing motion. This way, since $L = \frac{\mu_{0}N^{2}A}{l}$, the inductance would actually be proprtional to the change in the cross-sectional area of the ribcage and abdomen. in retrospect this is so obvious and I should've realised this before. I don't really care if my measurements aren't linearly related to the abdominal cross-sectional area so I'm not sure if I should try that method instead or not. I'm not sure how that would work in practice if the wire isn't stretchy though because it wouldn't get smaller as your belly goes in when you exhale since it would hold its shape? Also how many times/how tightly to wind it around? Plus, since the coil has to be one continuous piece of wire, the band would need to be a sewn-shut closed loop. This is awkward to put on by pulling the band over your head, and would make things awkward for users with different body sizes. Maybe there is a way to make it work . . . like maybe some small disc that is slid over the end of the wire and forces it . . . or maybe the inductor can be sliced open and closed around the user as long as the ends of the wire are aligned properly when it's closed back up and it wouldn't be a problem if they overlap a little or there's overhang? this could work, need to think about this more 

here's photos of the setup I tested and the scope

next: 
- test this setup with a known inductor value to check that it actually works (it would be nice if i could find a bigger capacitor too since L is so small but idk if capacitors much bigger than that )
- make band with higher L -> decide whether to stick with current shape, increasing number of turns/decreasing length, or wrap wire the other direction 
- need to obtain more of that enameled copper wire . . . would like to buy my own entire roll of it instead of taking from whichever workshop space i found it in, but I already checked if I could find any from a lot of places and couldn't. might have to resort to "unethical" means of acquiring 
- also, figure out why it still looks kind of weird on the scope . . .
