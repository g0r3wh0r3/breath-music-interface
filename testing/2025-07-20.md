so far we have tested with some thick, insulated wire loosely coiled around a band of elastic. Observed change in voltage measured across the band as it was stretched when supplied w/ sine wave, I think it was 40kHz? 

Working on sewing thinner, enamel-coated wire into the band. wire keeps breaking and tangling, process is time-consuming.
